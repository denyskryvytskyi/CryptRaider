# CryptRaider

This is a 3D game created in Unreal Engine 5 as part of the Unreal Engine 5 C++ Developer: Learn C++ & Make Video Games course. The game features a level with 3D puzzles where a player can grab objects and use them for the walls/doors unlocking to find a gold statue.

Here are some specific things I learned while making this game:
- Implemented Actor/Scene components for gameplay logic like grabbing objects and triggering specific areas.
- Lighting with Lumen technology.
- Modular Level design.
- Line Tracing and collisions.
- Calling C++ from Blueprints.
- Simple HUD with crosshair and "Quest Complete" message.
- Background sound, footstep sound, and pick up/ drop object sounds.
