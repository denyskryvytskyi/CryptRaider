# CryptRaider

This is a 3D game created in Unreal Engine 5 as part of the Unreal Engine 5 C++ Developer: Learn C++ & Make Video Games course. The game features a level with 3D puzzles where a player can grab objects and use them for the walls/doors unlocking to achieve a gold statue.

Here are some specific things I learned while making this game:
- Usage of Actor Component and Scene Components and making custom ones for game logic.
- Lighting with Lumen technology.
- Modular Level design.
- Line Tracing and collisions.
- Calling C++ from Blueprints.
